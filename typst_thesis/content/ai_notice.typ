- *Writing assistance:* This thesis was written with the help of DeepL from DeepL SE in order to improve the consistency and clarity of the text, ensure correct spelling and grammer and to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

- *Development assistance:* The tool _MCS Analyser_ tool was developed with the assistance of Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 from Anthropic. It was used to:
  - Explain complex concepts in binary analysis in a more understandable or simplified way.
  - Help with the structure and organisation of the codebase.
  - Generate small examples and snippets to demonstrate how things could be implemented.

  Example prompts:

  _I have multiple Input Hooks and need a python function to dynamically determine which class to instantiate based on the input type. How can I achieve this?_

  _Angr finds most external functions twice in the binary. Do you have an idea what could be the reason for this?_

  The *schnauzer* visualisation tool is not part of this thesis, but was developed by the author to supplement the visualisation. It was primarily developed using Claude Opus 4 and 4.1, with the author overseeing and controlling the process.
