abstract = {Abstract:
A multicomponent system is a structural system consisting of a certain number of components of specific form, a container and the supporting structure that interconnects the components and the container for its integrity. Most structural systems in mechanical and aerospace engineering can be considered as a kind of multicomponent system. Compactness, structural efficiency, static and dynamic responses have to be optimized for the functionality and mechanical performance. On the one hand, the given components are assembled in the limited space of the container to satisfy various functional constraints, which are a packing optimization or a layout optimization. On the other hand, proper supporting structures have to be identified to satisfy the mechanical performances of the system, which is a typical topology optimization. In this work, the integrated layout and topology optimization are discussed for the maximum rigidity design where the spatial placement of components and the configuration of the supporting structure have to be optimized simultaneously.}
