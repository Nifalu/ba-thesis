*Writing Assistance*

This thesis was written with the help of DeepL from DeepL SE in order to improve the consistency and clarity of the text, ensure correct spelling and grammer and to enhance the overall quality of the writing.

*Development Assistance*

The tool *MCS Analyser* was developed with the assistance of Claude Opus 4 and 4.1 from Anthropic. It was used to:
- Explain complex concepts in binary analysis in a more understandable or simplified way.
- Help with the structure and organization of the codebase.
- Generate small examples and snippets to demonstrate how things could be implemented.

Example prompts:

_I have multiple Input Hooks and need a python function to dynamically determine which class to instantiate based on the input type. How can I achieve this?_

_Angr finds most external functions twice in the binary. Do you have an idea what could be the reason for this?_


The visualisation tool *Schnauzer* is not part of this thesis but was written by the author to supplement the visualisation. It was written with heavy use of Claude Opus 4 and 4.1.
